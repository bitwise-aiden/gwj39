Theme: Inversion
Wildcards:
	- [ ] Prithee, Speak! - Have a system for talking to NPCs in your game
	- [ ] Kids these days - Have a character complain about everything the player does
	- [x] Mobile friendly - Make sure your HTML5 build can be played from a touch screen

Board inversion game thing
- Two players to be able to move around the board
	- Cardinal direction input
	- Player continues to move in current direction until another direction is pressed
- As the player touches a square, they will convert it to their colour.
	- Squares start off as grey
	- Players will have two opposite colours to switch to
- Power ups
	- Speed
	- Bomb: Stun anyone in blast radius, and reset colours to default


Goals for this jam!
